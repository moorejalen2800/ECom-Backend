# ECom_Backend

In this project I was tasked with creating the back-end for a hypothetical E-Commerce web site. I employed Sequelize to connect the MYSQL database to the relevant server end points. In addition, I checked the connectivity of the end points with Insomnia.

# Description


 The database was seeded with previously developed starter code, and had three tables: Category, Product, and Tag. The latter two tables were related in a many-to-many relationship, which demanded successful implementation of a "through" statement with a linking ProductTag table to simulate the SQL join.
